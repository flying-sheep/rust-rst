Designed around the `Docutils Document Tree`_ and the `reStructuredText specification`_,
this is supposed to become a library able to convert reStructuredText and Docutils XML to both each other and HTML5.

Currently it can convert a subset of rST (e.g. this README) to HTML5:

.. code-block:: bash

   cargo install rst
   rst README.rst
   # or
   cargo run -- README.rst

This project is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and MIT.

.. _reStructuredText specification: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

.. note::
   If you are looking for the requirements tracking tool rst (Requirements, Specifications and Tests),
   have a look at the rst_app package instead.

Inspiration
-----------
The design was inspired by the comrak_ Markdown parser library.
The rST grammar was inspired by peg-rst_
